# crud-sqlite-node

A small CRUD backend and REST API for SQLite in Node.js

An SQLite version of the [mern-crud-backend](https://github.com/lalugue/mern-crud-backend)

# How to install

Run the following command:

```
npm install
```

# How to run

Run the following command:

```
npm start
```

The backend will automatically create `todos.db` in the `./db` folder if it does not exist yet

Once it's up and running, try consuming the API by making HTTP requests (eg: with API clients such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or any other tool)

# Routes

Each route is described in the `server.js` file
